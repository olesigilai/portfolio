## Description of my portfolio
This project has all the information of things I have been able to do both proffessionally and education achievement. A portfolio is a curriculum  vitae and purposely for letting  people who want to offer you job get more information about me. The website will act as a  direction for those people who will require a curriculum  vitae as a live link instead of documented hard/soft copy curriculum vitae.
