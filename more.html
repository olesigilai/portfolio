      <p>All said and done, I cleared my second time KCPE exams in 2011 and achieved
          347 marks 
     </p>
      <p>Gideon received an admission letter from Narok Boys High School. In the letter 
        was a fee structure which to a family that had before not admitted a student 
    to a provisional  school, sounded to have been hacked somewhere and values meddled....</p>
    <p >It did not end here I joined Narok Boys and later dropped in form one term two after
         a series of demonstrations by students which prompted fee clearance upon reporting
        back to school, which was tough for me. This made me opt for a home day-mixed secondary
         school. I later tranfered to a boarding school later in the second term of Form two to better my perfomance where 
        I cleared and attained a Grade of B plain in 2016.</p>
        <p>My passion on programming has always ranged in my mind and this year am pleased having gotten scholarship at Moringa school to pursue my dream</p>
