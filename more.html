      <p>All said and done, I cleared my second time KCPE exams in 2011 and achieved
          347 marks despite my several days of absentism in the name of fee collection 
          which by now sounds funny because it was only Ksh.500 for a whole term 
          but it would take a peasant parent 3 weeks to get at least a half of it.

      <p>Gideon received an admission letter from Narok Boys High School. In the letter 
        was a fee structure which to a family that had before not admitted a student 
    to a provision school, sounded to have been hacked somewhere and values meddled....</p>
    <p >It did not end here I joined Narok Boys and later dropped in form one term two after
         a series of demonstrations by students which prompted fee clearance upon reporting
        back to school, which was tough for me. This made me opt for a home day-mixed secondary
         school. I later tranfered to a boarding school later in the second term of Form two to better my perfomance where 
        I cleared and attained a Grade of B plain in 2016.</p>
