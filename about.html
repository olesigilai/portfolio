    <h1>About Gideon and Education;</h1>
    <p>
        Gideon is Kenyan Citizen by birth aged 22years old. He started Schooling
        in 2003 and Cleared Class Eight in 2010 at Kataret Primary School in
        Chepalungu constituency in Bomet County. In 2011, the boy was supposed to
        join form one now that he had qualified by scoring 301 marks in KCPE but
        due to the background history of financial instability and now that he had
        a sister who had just joined secondary school.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was now no option other than withdrawing my interest of joining
        secondary school and for the second time went back to class Eight but in a
        different school. It is now 2011 February and my usuall "to and
        fro-school" narrative for fees started, but it never bothered me because
        everyother student in my community had in mind the "Chased to collect
        school fees" habbit, my only dream killer was when we coincidently met
        with my peers whom we cleared KCPE together in 2010 with those brilliant
        uniforms.
      </p>
      <p>All said and done, I cleared my second time KCPE exams in 2011 and achieved
          347 marks despite my several days of absentism in the name of fee collection 
          which by now sounds funny because it was only Ksh.500 for a whole term 
          but it would take a peasant parent 3 weeks to get at least a half of it.

      <p>Gideon received an admission letter from Narok Boys High School. In the letter 
        was a fee structure which to a family that had before not admitted a student 
    to a provision school, sounded to have been hacked somewhere and values meddled....</p>
    <p>It did not end here I joined Narok Boys and later dropped in form one term two after
         a series of demonstrations by students which prompted fee clearance upon reporting
        back to school, which was tough for me. This made me opt for a home day-mixed secondary school.</p>
